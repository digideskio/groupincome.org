## What is the minimum size for a group?

There is no minimum size for a group, so long as the group can meet its basic income. Two individuals could form a group, and even a single individual with sufficient resources could provide their own basic income.


## How can I do this today?

- Establish a group
- Decide on a basic income amount
- Implement Group Income going forward
